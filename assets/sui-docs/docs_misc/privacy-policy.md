You understand and agree that you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy if you continue to use our Services after the new Privacy Policy takes effect.
## Personal information we collect

B. Information Collected Automatically
We may collect personal information automatically when you use our Services:
  * **Automatic Data Collection**. We may collect certain information automatically when you use our Services, such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, browser or device information, location information (including approximate location derived from IP address), Internet service provider, and metadata about the content you provide. We may also automatically collect information regarding your use of our Services, such as pages that you visit before, during and after using our Services, information about the links you click, the types of content you interact with, the frequency and duration of your activities, and other information about how you use our Services.
  * **Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Other Technologies**.

  * Cookies. Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers that store preferences and facilitate and enhance your experience.
  * Pixel Tags/Web Beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in our Services that collects information about engagement on our Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.


C. Information Collected from Other Sources
  * **Third-Party Sources**. We may obtain information about you from other sources, including through third-party services and organizations. For example, if you access our Services through a third-party application, such as an app store, a third-party login service, or a social networking site, we may collect information about you from that third-party application that you have made available via your privacy settings.

Our Services may offer various tools and functionalities that allow you to provide information about your friends through our referral service; third parties may also use these services to upload information about you. Our referral services may also allow you to forward or share certain content with a friend or colleague, such as an email inviting your friend to use our Services. Please only share with us contact information of people with whom you have a relationship (e.g., relative, friend, neighbor, or co-worker).

If you have any questions about our marketing practices, you may contact us at any time as set forth in âContact Usâ below.
D. With Your Consent
We may use personal information for other purposes that are clearly disclosed to you at the time you provide personal information or with your consent.
E. Other Purposes
We also use your information for other purposes as requested by you or as permitted by applicable law.
## How we disclose your information
We disclose your personal information to third parties for a variety of business purposes, including to provide our Services, to protect us or others, or in the event of a major business transaction such as a merger, sale, or asset transfer, as described below.
**Notice Regarding Use of the Blockchain. Aspects of our Services may be hosted on or interact with the blockchain. Where you use aspects of our Services that are hosted on or interact with the blockchain, information about your interactions and/or transactions will be provided to the applicable blockchain network and may be accessible to third parties due to the nature of the blockchain protocol. Because entries to the Sui Blockchain are, by their nature, public, and because it may be possible for someone to identify you through your pseudonymous, public wallet address using external sources of information, any transaction you enter onto the Sui Blockchain could possibly be used to identify you, or information about you.**
A. Disclosures to Provide our Services
The categories of third parties with whom we may share your information are described below.
  * **Service Providers**. We may share your personal information with our third-party service providers who use that information to help us provide our Services. This includes service providers and vendors that provide us with IT support, hosting, customer service, and related services.
  * **Google Analytics**. For more information about how Google uses your data (including for its own purposes, e.g., for profiling or linking it to other data), please visit Google Analyticsâ Privacy Policy. To learn more about how to opt-out of Google Analyticsâ use of your information, please click here.
  * **Microsoft Clarity**. We partner with Microsoft Clarity and Microsoft Advertising to capture how you use and interact with our website through behavioral metrics, heatmaps, and session replay to improve and market our products/services. Website usage data is captured using first and third-party cookies and other tracking technologies to determine the popularity of products/services and online activity. Additionally, we use this information for site optimization, fraud/security purposes, and advertising. For more information about how Microsoft collects and uses your data, visit the Microsoft Privacy Statement.
  * **Business Partners**. We may share your personal information with business partners to provide you with a product or service you have requested. We may also share your personal information to business partners with whom we jointly offer products or services.

In addition, to complete transfers via the Services, we will need to share some of your personal information with the party that you are transacting with.
  * **Advertising Partners**. We may share your personal information with third-party advertising partners. These third-party advertising partners may set Technologies and other tracking tools on our Services to collect information regarding your activities and your device (e.g., your IP address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of day). These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other services) for purposes of delivering personalized advertisements to you when you visit digital properties within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as âinterest-based advertisingâ, âtargeted advertising,â âpersonalized advertising,â or âcross-context behavioral advertising.â


B. Disclosures to Protect Us or Others
We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; protect your, our, or othersâ rights, property, or safety; enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.
C. Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers

## Your privacy choices and rights
**Your Privacy Choices**. The privacy choices you may have about your personal information are determined by applicable law and are described below.

Note that you will continue to receive transfer-related emails regarding Services you have requested. We may also send you certain non-promotional communications regarding us and our Services, and you will not be able to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding our Services or updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy).

  * **Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising**. You may stop or restrict the placement of Technologies on your device or remove them by adjusting your preferences as your browser or device permits.

  * Access Personal Information about you, including: (i) confirming whether we are processing your personal information; (ii) obtaining access to or a copy of your personal information; or (iii) receiving an electronic copy of personal information that you have provided to us, or asking us to send that information to another company (aka the right of data portability);

  * Request Deletion of your personal information in some limited circumstances;
  * Request to Opt-Out of Certain Processing Activities including, as applicable, if we process your personal information for âtargeted advertisingâ (as âtargeted advertisingâ is defined by applicable privacy laws), if we âsellâ your personal information (as âsellâ is defined by applicable privacy laws), or if we engage in âprofilingâ in furtherance of certain âdecisions that produce legal or similarly significant effectsâ concerning you (as such terms are defined by applicable privacy laws);

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as set forth in âContact Usâ below. We will process such requests in accordance with applicable laws.
To protect your privacy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before fulfilling requests submitted under applicable privacy laws. These steps may involve asking you to provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. Examples of our verification process may include asking you to confirm the email address we have associated with you.
Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf in certain jurisdictions, may make a request to exercise the rights listed above regarding your personal information. If your personal information is subject to a law that allows an authorized agent to act on your behalf in exercising your privacy rights and you wish to designate an authorized agent, please provide written authorization signed by you and your designated agent using the information found in âContact Usâ below and ask us for additional instructions.
Some laws may allow you to appeal our decision if we decline to process your request. If applicable laws grant you an appeal right and you would like to appeal our decision with respect to your request, you may do so by informing us of this and providing us with information supporting your appeal.
## International data transfers
All information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including, but not limited to, the United States or other countries which may not offer equivalent protection of personal information as under the Data Protection Legislation and otherwise may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. We endeavor to safeguard your information consistent with the requirements of applicable laws, including Data Protection Legislation and, in such cases, we will process personal information or procure that it be processed in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Legislation, which may include having appropriate contractual undertakings in legal agreements with service providers who process personal information on our behalf.
If we transfer personal information which originates in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom to a country that has not been found to provide an adequate level of protection under applicable data protection laws, one of the safeguards we may use to support such transfer is the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.
For more information about the safeguards we use for international transfers of your personal information, please contact us as set forth below.
## Retention of personal information
We store the personal information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we may consider applicable legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, certain risk factors, the purposes for which we process your personal information, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
We expect to delete your personal information (at the latest) once there is no longer any legal or regulatory requirement or legitimate business purpose for retaining your personal information.
## Childrenâs Information
The Services are not directed to children under 16 (or other age as required by local law), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, you may contact us as set forth in âContact Usâ below. If we learn that we have collected a childâs personal information in violation of applicable law, we will promptly take steps to delete such information unless we have a legal obligation to keep it.
## Third-party websites/ applications
The Services may contain links to other websites/applications (such as GitHub) and other websites/applications may reference or link to our Services or the Services may allow you to interact with third-party services, such as cryptocurrency exchanges. These third-party services are not controlled by us. We encourage our users to read the privacy policies of each website and application with which they interact. We do not endorse, screen or approve, and are not responsible for the third partyâs actions or omissions, including but not limited to their privacy practices, content of such other websites or applications, and errors or bugs in their software. Providing personal information to third-party websites or applications is at your own risk.
## Supervisory authority and other provisions related to GDPR
If you are located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, or Brazil, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe our processing of your personal information violates applicable law.

To designate an authorized agent, please contact us as set forth in âContact Usâ below and provide written authorization signed by you and your designated agent.
**Verification.** To protect your privacy, we will take the following steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request. When you make a request, we will ask you to provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include confirming the email address associated with any personal information we have about you. If you are a California resident and would like to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, please contact us as set forth in âContact Usâ below. We will process such requests in accordance with applicable laws.
**Refer-a-Friend and Similar Incentive Programs.** As described above in âHow We Use of Your Information,â we may offer referral programs or other incentivized data collection programs. For example, we may offer incentives to you such as discounts or promotional items or credit in connection with these programs, wherein you provide your personal information in exchange for a reward, or provide personal information regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their email address) and receive rewards when they sign up to use our Services. (The referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your data to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred partyâs data to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately becomes a user and uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program.
**Accessibility.** This Privacy Policy uses industry-standard technologies and was developed in line with the World Wide Web Consortiumâs Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version 2.1. If you wish to print this policy, please do so from your web browser or by saving the page as a PDF.
**California Shine the Light.** The California âShine the Lightâ law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those parties.
**Right for minors to remove posted content.** Where required by law, California residents under the age of 18 may request to have their posted content or information removed from the publicly viewable portions of the Services by contacting us directly as set forth in âContact Usâ below.
