# Move References
Move is an open source language for writing safe packages to manipulate on-chain objects (sometimes referred to as "smart contracts"). Move is a platform-agnostic language to enable common libraries, tooling, and developer communities across blockchains with vastly different data and execution models. Move is adaptable to meet the needs of the blockchain the code operates on, see Move on Sui to review enhancements made to Move for optimization on the Sui blockchain.
  * Sui Framework: Provides `cargo doc`-generated content for core Sui modules.
  * The Move Book: A definitive guide for learning the Move language on Sui.
  * The Move Reference: Architecture and syntax reference for the Move language.
