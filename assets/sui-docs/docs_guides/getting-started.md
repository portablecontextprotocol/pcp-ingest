# Getting Started
Sui is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform. That might read like marketing speak, but as you peruse the documentation to understand the technology, you will discover that Sui addresses many of the problems that hold blockchains back from mass adoption.
Before you can get started developing on Sui, you need to understand the code repository and install its binaries.
## Install Sui​
Use one of the following commands for Homebrew (MacOS, Linux, or Windows Subsystem for Linux) or Chocolatey (Windows) to install Sui.
  * Homebrew
  * Chocolatey


```
$ brew install sui  

```

```
$ choco install sui  

```

Find more versions of Sui for Windows on the Chocolatey community website.
You can also install Sui from binaries or from source, as detailed in the Install Sui page.
Go to Install Sui.
## After installing Sui​
After you have Sui installed on your system, you can begin to connect with a network and publish smart contracts.
  * Connect to a Sui Network
  * Connect to a Local Network
  * Get Sui Address
  * Get SUI Coins
https://faucet.sui.io/: Visit the online faucet to request SUI tokens. You can refresh your browser to perform multiple requests, but the requests are rate-limited per IP address.


## Access Sui data​
Outline of the interfaces that are currently available to access the Sui network data, along with an overview of how that's gradually evolving.
