How can I find the current RFPs and submit a proposal?

What if there are no RFPs currently available?
This likely means that the Sui Foundation is reviewing previous RFP submissions for decision and working on publishing new project ideas. Please check back regularly as RFPs are launched on a rolling basis.
How long will it take to receive a decision from the Sui Foundation?
Typically, it takes approximately four weeks from the close date of the RFP, with an additional two weeks to complete the compliance process for the chosen proposal candidates. Timing varies depending on the number of proposals received.
How are proposals evaluated and selected?
Evaluation criteria include factors such as technical feasibility, innovation, relevance to the RFP's objectives, potential impact on the Sui community, and the applicant's track record or experience.

After review, the shortlisted proposals undergo discussion and final voting by an RFP committee to determine the candidate with the highest potential to address the RFP's requirements and contribute positively to the Sui ecosystem.

Yes, the final agreement includes funding and a budget for the winning applicant.
