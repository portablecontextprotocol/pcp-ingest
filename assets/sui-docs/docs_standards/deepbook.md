# DeepBook
DeepBook is a next-generation decentralized central limit order book (CLOB) built on Sui. DeepBook leverages Sui's parallel execution and low transaction fees to bring a highly performant, low-latency exchange on chain.
## Versioning​
The latest development iteration of DeepBook is version 3 (DeepBookV3). DeepBookV3 is currently available across all Sui networks. DeepBookV2 is now deprecated. Merge any existing integrations to DeepBookV3.
## Open source​
DeepBook is open for community development. You can use the Sui Improvement Proposals (SIPs) process to suggest changes to make DeepBook better.
