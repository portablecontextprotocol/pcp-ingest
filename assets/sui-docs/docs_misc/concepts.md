# Sui Concepts Overview
Sui is different than other blockchains. The concepts explored in this section provide a background to the Sui blockchain and Web3 in general.
## App developers​
## Move overview
Move is an open-source language for writing safe packages to manipulate on-chain objects
## Package upgrades
Sui provides a method of upgrading your packages while still retaining their immutable properties.
## Gaming on Sui
Sui offers features like dynamic NFTs, kiosks, soulbound assets, and on-chain randomness, to provide builders with the tools to create immersive, transparent, and fair gaming experiences.
## The Move Book
A comprehensive guide to the Move programming language on the Sui blockchain.
## Objects​
## Object Model
Everything on the Sui blockchain is an object, with metadata, type of ownership, and a referencing scheme.
## Transfer to Object
On Sui, you can transfer objects to objects in the same way you can transfer objects to addresses.
## Cryptography​
## zkLogin
zkLogin is a Sui primitive that enables you to send transactions from a Sui address using an OAuth credential, without publicly linking the two.
## Transaction authentication
Transaction security is arguably the most important feature of a blockchain. Sui provides multiple features to secure your transactions, whether on chain or off.
## Tokenomics​
## SUI tokenomics
The term "tokenomics" is a combination of two words, “token” and “economics”, that is generally used to describe the economic principles and behaviors of a blockchain. 
## Gas in Sui
A Sui transaction must pay for both the computational cost of execution and the long-term cost of storing the objects a transaction creates or mutates.
## Vesting strategies
If you plan to launch a token on Sui, then you might consider implementing a vesting strategy to strengthen the long-term outlook of your token.
