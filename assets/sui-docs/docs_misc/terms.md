To make these Terms easier to read, the Site and our services (including Beta Services) are collectively called the â**Interface.** â The Interface may facilitate interaction with the Sui decentralized cryptographic protocols, maintained by third party open source communities, which we do not own or control (the â**Protocol** â) allowing for activities such as the creation of non-fungible tokens (â**NFTs** â), blockchain games, DeFi apps, marketplaces, automated market makers, and wallets. **BY USING THESE SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE NOT A PERSON OR ENTITY WHO IS RESIDENT IN, A CITIZEN OF, IS LOCATED IN, IS INCORPORATED IN, OR HAS A REGISTERED OFFICE IN ANY RESTRICTED TERRITORY, AS DEFINED BELOW (ANY SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY FROM A RESTRICTED TERRITORY, ARE REFERRED TO HEREIN AS A âRESTRICTED PERSONâ).** WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND SUI FOUNDATION THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 15 âDISPUTE RESOLUTIONâ BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 15 WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU, BUT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 14 (GOVERNING LAW) WILL APPLY INSTEAD.

Changes to these Terms or the Interface
We may update the Terms, including any addendum terms, from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, weâll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site and/or may also send other communications. Itâs important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Interface. If you continue to use the Interface after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you donât agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Interface anymore. Because our Interface is evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Interface, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

You are solely responsible for all costs incurred by you in using the Interface, and for determining, collecting, reporting, and paying all applicable Taxes that you may be required by law to collect and remit to any governmental or regulatory agencies.

In accordance with its anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-fraud, and other compliance policies and practices, we may impose limitations and controls on the ability of you or any beneficiary to utilize the Interface. Such limitations may include rejecting transaction requests, freezing funds, or otherwise restricting you from using the Interface, all to the extent of our ability to do so.

Dispute Resolution
Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Interface (collectively, **âDisputesâ**) will be resolved **solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding**. You and Sui Foundation agree that the Cayman Islands Arbitration Law governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Sui Foundation are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.Exceptions. The Parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to or application of conflicts of law rules or principles. Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the formation, interpretation, breach or termination thereof, including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable, will be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration to be administered by the Cayman Islands International Centre (CIAC) and governed by the Arbitration Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language and the place of arbitration shall be in the Cayman Islands. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The place of arbitration will be George Town, Cayman Islands. The decision of the sole arbitrator to any such dispute, controversy, difference or claim shall be final and binding upon both parties. If any litigation or arbitration is necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to have their attorney fees paid by the other party. Each party waives any right it may have to assert the doctrine of forum non conveniens, to assert that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such arbitration or courts or to object to venue to the extent any proceeding is brought in accordance herewith. Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section 16(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partyâs individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration. Class Action Waiver. **YOU AND SUI FOUNDATION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** Further, if the partiesâ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another personâs claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 16(d) of these Terms (â**Class Action Waiver** â), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.
