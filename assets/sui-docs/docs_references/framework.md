# Sui Framework
The documentation in this section is created from the Rust `cargo doc` process. The process builds the content from comments in the source code.
## Framework documentation‚Äã
The child pages to this topic describe the module members for the following libraries:
## üóÉÔ∏è Bridge
8 items
## üóÉÔ∏è Std
21 items
## üóÉÔ∏è Sui
53 items
## üóÉÔ∏è Sui_system
11 items
## Source code‚Äã
You can find the source code for these Move modules in the crates/sui-framework/packages directory in the `sui` repository on GitHub. As previously mentioned, the comments included in the code provide context for the logic defined.
## Crate documentation‚Äã
You can review the raw `cargo doc` output of the following documentation in the `sui` repository. The .md files are located in the `crates/sui-framework/docs` directory. Online, they are located at https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-framework/docs.
## Build documentation locally‚Äã
The most recent documentation is always available in the `main` branch of the `sui` repository. You shouldn't need to build the documentation locally, but if the need arises you can:
  1. Open a terminal or console to the `sui/crates/sui-framework` directory.
  2. Run `cargo doc --workspace --exclude "sui-benchmark" --no-deps`.
  3. The docs are built to `crates/sui-framework/docs` into their respective subdirectories.


If the `cargo doc` process does not work as expected, try running `cargo clean` before attempting again.
