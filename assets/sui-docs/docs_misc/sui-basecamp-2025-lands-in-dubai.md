Sui Foundation and Mysten Labs invite the Sui community worldwide to join us at _Sui Basecamp_, the Sui ecosystem’s flagship conference, to be held in Dubai over May 1-2, 2025. Attendees will join thousands of Sui creators, builders, entrepreneurs, enthusiasts, and industry leaders to hear from top-tier speakers—including founders from inside and outside Sui—learn breaking news before anyone else, and gain insights into the blockchain fueling the mass adoption of Web3. 
## Speakers, sessions, and sneak-peeks
At last year’s event, the groundbreaking _SuiPlay0X1_—the world’s first blockchain-enabled handheld gaming console—was revealed to the world. For the first time ever, at this year’s Sui Basecamp, attendees will get hands-on access to try out this highly anticipated device—before pre-order shipments begin this summer.
This year’s conference attendees can expect the conference to reflect Sui’s ascent as one of the industry’s top ecosystems, with keynotes from leading figures from inside and outside the Sui ecosystem, info-packed sessions that unveil the roadmaps of key products and projects building on Sui, networking opportunities, and more. 
Announced speakers include:
  * The entire Mysten Labs founding team: Evan Cheng, CEO; Sam Blackshear, CTO; Adeniyi Adiobun, CPO; Kostas Chalkias, Chief Cryptographer; George Danezis, Chief Scientist
  * Raoul Pal, CEO, Real Vision
  * Christian Thompson, Managing Director, Sui Foundation
  * Rebecca Simmonds, Managing Executive, Walrus Foundation
  * Nic Cabana, Co-Founder, Claynosaurz, a flagship partner of _Walrus_, the decentralized storage solution built on Sui, which launched on Mainnet this week 
  * Nikos Porfyris, COO, Athens Exchange Group
  * Fisher Yu, Co-Founder and CTO, Babylon Labs
  * Elliscope Fang, Co-Founder, NAVI Protocol

Christian Thompson, Managing Director of Sui Foundation, said: “The Sui ecosystem has seen meteoric growth since the first Sui Basecamp almost a year ago—powered by a vibrant community of enthusiasts, builders, entrepreneurs, partners, and industry leaders. As we learned from the first conference, bringing the Sui ecosystem together produces unmatched energy and insights. We invite you to help us honor the Sui community, celebrate the fruits of our shared commitment, and chart our course for the future together.” 
## A year of growth 
Last year’s inaugural event in Paris saw 1,100 attendees from 65 countries come together to celebrate the community driving Sui’s meteoric growth, with an even greater turnout anticipated this year. Sui Basecamp 2024 featured over 100 speakers across 44 sessions, with major announcements including: unveiling the world’s first blockchain-based handheld gaming console, _SuiPlay0X1_; _NHN_ doing a deep dive into their development efforts on Sui; and _First Digital_ announcing it would natively deploy the _FDUSD_ stablecoin on Sui. 
Since Sui Basecamp 2024, where speakers from Sui and Mysten discussed the early path forward to a new internet, the Sui community has achieved significant milestones in early adoption, including: 
  * The mainnet launch of _Walrus_ earlier this month—a faster, more robust, and more reliable solution than other decentralized storage systems, with $140M in capital raised to scale its solutions.
  * Announcements with major partners, including _Canary Capital's filing of a SUI ETF_, _Sega’s _Code of Joker: Evolutions__ game, and a surge of institutional interest in Sui, with the likes of _Grayscale_, _Franklin Templeton_, _VanEck_, and _Ant Financial_ all launching investment products or initiatives on the Sui Network. 
  * The launch of _Sui Bridge_ in September 2024, allowing seamless asset transfers between Sui and Ethereum—over 25,000 ETH (over $51.9M USD at the time of writing) have since been transferred to Sui. 
  * Sui’s total monthly active wallets reached a peak of 17.6M in February 2025, the highest count recorded to date.
