# SUI Token Community Access Program
The SUI Token Community Access Program enables Sui community members to obtain SUI tokens in the early phases of the network's life.
Please note US citizens and/or residents are ineligible to receive SUI as part of the Community Access Program.  
  
The Sui Foundation has always stated clearly that there will not be any airdrops of SUI. Below we outline the various ways SUI has been allocated within this program.
Retrospective Awards and a Recognition Sale for Sui Champions & Supporters
### Open to select participants in the development of Sui to date
This group is comprised of participants in the Sui ecosystem, who have supported the network since inception through meaningful contributions. These participants have operated as testers, community managers, contributors, builders and much more. Sui would not be where it is without these participants and it is critical they are recognized for their efforts. Eligible recipients are as follows:
1. 
Competition Winners from Capy Holidays
As part of the Capy Holidays competition run during the Wave 1 testing round, a number of winners were selected via voting on social media. Winners have been contacted directly and will receive tokens in line with the stated competition terms.
2. Champions
This group has been identified based on their direct actions and contributions to support the network. Recipients in this group have taken on roles as testers and moderators, they have attended Builder Houses and key events, sometimes helping to organize and run them. But no matter the role they have filled or task they have completed, they have all demonstrated their passion for Sui by contributing significant time and effort.
â
This group will receive a grant of SUI after the network hits mainnet. Recipients will be contacted directly and will be able to access their tokens at a future date.
3. Supporters
This category is reserved for the dedicated Sui Discord community who have joined what we fondly call the âSuinamiâ, offering suggestions, participating in discussions, interacting with ecosystem projects, and advocating for technical innovations. 
â
This cohort includes participants who joined the community before February 1, 2023.
â
It also includes our Frenemies Competition Winners who will receive direct communication on how to purchase SUI in the Recognition Sale. Supporters on Discord have been notified via community channels about how to verify their eligibility. Information has been published in open channels only. Once their tenure on the server is confirmed, they will receive further instructions on how to make their purchase. Interested purchasers must complete account registration and verification with the applicable exchange following the instructions and timeline provided by the applicable exchange.
General Sale via Select Exchanges
### Open to the public
The SUI token will be available for general purchase via KuCoin and OKX, subject to the following conditions: 
  * Not available to US citizens and/or residents.
  * Exchange terms and conditions apply, including know-your-customer and sanctions checks, and any restrictions on providing services to persons located in certain countries. A minimum account balance established by exchanges may apply.
  * Interested purchasers must complete account registration and verification with the applicable exchange following the instructions and timeline provided by the applicable exchange.
  * Purchase and transfer limits apply. 


For more information, please visit the exchanges directly to learn about the sale.
Aiming for Success
As any World Cup team knows, the road to success lies between clearly defined goal posts. The Sui Foundationâs SUI Token Community Access Program is no different, and has been designed with the goal of:
  * Maximizing geographic coverage where permissible: The Sui community is global in reach and, as such, token distribution should permit broad participation across all regions of the world.
  * Empowering robust and fair participation: The aim is to make SUI tokens as broadly accessible as possible, while also recognizing and ensuring access to early Sui contributors and supporters.


The Sui Foundation will continue to work on ensuring this program delivers on its goals. In the meantime, drop a line on our Discord channels, apply for a developer grant, and keep learning about Sui.
Terms and Conditions
To be eligible to participate in the Community Access Program you must be of the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence. 
â
U.S. citizens and/or residents are ineligible to participate in the Community Access Program. 
â
Eligibility for tokens are subject to applicable law, âknow your customer,â and sanctions compliance requirements, and may be contingent upon providing certain identifying and related information about you and your organization. Exchange terms and conditions apply to receipt of tokens via an exchange, including any restrictions on providing services to persons located in certain countries. Supply is fixed. Purchase limits may apply.
â
Sui Foundation reserves the right to terminate the Community Access Program in whole or in part at any time without prior notice. We may change or modify the amounts of tokens and/or discontinue, or terminate, temporarily or permanently, all or any part of the tokens at any time and without notice, and we may elect not to provide any tokens to any person(s). We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to restrict any person(s) from receipt of tokens who we find to be acting in violation of these terms, to be acting in an unethical or disruptive manner or in a manner inconsistent with the values of Sui Foundation, or with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other person, as we determine in our sole discretion. Participants are responsible for the payment of all taxes associated with receipt of any tokens. 
â
Participants must provide us with any additional information and complete any required tax or other forms relating to receipt of such tokens. The Sui Foundation privacy policy (located at sui.io/policy) applies to the Community Access Program. By choosing to participate, participants agree to be bound by the terms of such privacy policy.
Community Access Program FAQ
General
Supporters
### What is the SUI Token Community Access Program?
The SUI Token Community Access Program enables Sui community members to obtain SUI tokens in the early phases of the network's life.
### How can I get into the SUI Token Community Access Program?
The Community Access Program will allow Sui community members and the general public to obtain SUI directly. A retrospective award and a recognition sale will be offered to people who have been instrumental in bringing the Sui network and ecosystem to life, including people who have operated as testers, community managers, contributors, builders, and otherwise supported the Sui community from day 1 until February 1st 2023. In addition, a broader audience is able to purchase the SUI token by registering with one of the participating exchanges. All recipients will need to pass identity verification by the exchanges. The program is not open to US citizens and/or residents.
### Why are US residents and citizens ineligible?
As much as we would like to, US citizens and/or residents are ineligible for this offer at this time.
### When will I know if I have received an award?
If you are in the group being given a retrospective award, you will be contacted directly and invited to register with an exchange to claim your tokens. If you are purchasing tokens in connection with the Recognition Sale, you will be notified by the exchange you registered with if you have been successful in receiving an allocation to purchase.
### How will verification portal submissions be processed?
A random selection algorithm will be used to select submissions for the exchange allowlists. Assuming each purchaser makes the maximum purchase, we estimate that approximately 96K supporters will be able to participate (exact numbers cannot be defined at this time) in the Recognition Sale.
### How does the random selection algorithm work?
The random selection algorithm uses Hashshuffle and factors in applicable restrictions to generate an ordered allowlist that will be shared with each exchange, in proportion to their token allocation.   
  
Hashshuffle is a sortition (randomization) protocol that uses publicly verifiable random beacons to shuffle a list of entries or perform random sampling in a secure, fair and reproducible way. The algorithm can be used to run transparent raffles and giveaways, but can also be used for sampling in statistical analysis and as a tie-breaker method; the goal is to protect against misbehaving organizers or participants, by not allowing prediction or manipulation of the shuffled results.
