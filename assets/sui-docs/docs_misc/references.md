# References Overview
Already familiar with Sui? Use these valuable resources to continue your development journey.
## Sui RPC​
Reference the Sui framework and Sui RPC documentation for details of the code that powers the Sui blockchain.
## GraphQL for Sui RPC
GraphQL is a public service for the Sui RPC that enables you to efficiently interact with the Sui network.
## JSON-RPC
Use GraphQL for the Sui RPC for new projects. Use the JSON-RPC reference for legacy projects that have not migrated to GraphQL yet.
## Move​
Move powers smart contract logic for the Sui blockchain. Use these resources to learn Move or refresh your memory.
## Sui framework
The Sui framework libraries include Move modules that provide the logic for Sui and its standards. A Rust process creates the documentation for the modules directly from comments in the code.
## The Move Book
The Move Book is a comprehensive guide to the Move programming language on the Sui blockchain.
## The Move Reference
The Move Reference documents the architecture and syntax of the Move programming language.
## Sui CLI​
Interact directly with Sui networks and its features using the Sui command line interface (CLI). The CLI is divided into separate base commands that target a specific set of features.
## Sui Client CLI
Create a client on a Sui network to generate addresses, access networks, and more with the Sui Client CLI.
## Sui Client PTB CLI
Build, preview, and execute programmable transaction blocks directly from your terminal with the Sui Client PTB CLI.
## Sui Move CLI
Access Sui Move functions on chain using the Sui Move CLI.
## Sui IDE support​
Use the Move and Move Trace Debugger extensions for VSCode to quickly navigate and edit your Move codebase, and debug execution traces.
## Move
The Move extension provides language support features like code navigation, completion, and diagnostics for Move source code.
## Move Trace Debugger
Debug Move execution traces directly in VS Code to understand how your code executes.
## Sui software development kits​
Official software development kits (SDKs) available for Sui include the TypeScript SDK and Rust SDK.
## Sui TypeScript SDK
The Sui TypeScript SDK has its own microsite. Click this box to go there.
## Sui Rust SDK
The Sui Rust SDK provides Rust wrappers around the Sui API. Using the SDK, you can interact with Sui networks using the Rust programming language.
