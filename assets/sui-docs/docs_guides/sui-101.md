# Sui 101
In many education systems, 101-level classes are those that teach core competencies to build a foundation for the more advanced topics that are to come. The topics in this section provide the same experience for the Sui blockchain. They examine the core Sui development concepts that you use to build apps on Sui. As you start developing more advanced solutions, knowledge of these topics provides a good base for understanding the more advanced concepts you will employ.
## Working with PTBs​
You can create programmable transaction blocks (PTBs) on Sui to perform multiple commands in a single transaction. The Working with PTBs topics demonstrate how to build efficient PTBs using the Sui TypeScript SDK.
Go to Working with PTBs.
## Using Events​
You can emit events from your published packages on the Sui network. Using Events demonstrates how to emit events from your on-chain packages and monitor the activity of other objects emitting events.
Go to Using Events.
## Shared versus Owned Objects​
Objects on Sui, unlike other blockchains, can be owned as well as shared. You can create transactions that leverage either type or both. Shared versus Owned Objects examines the differences and what considerations you should account for when deciding how to structure your on-chain app.
Go to Shared versus Owned Objects.
## Access On-Chain Time​
Sui provides a `Clock` module you can use to get network-based time. Access On-Chain Time examines the `Clock` module and the behavior of the available methods that affect transaction processing speed and the temporal exactness of the data you receive.
Go to Access On-Chain Time.
