Although a relative newcomer to the blockchain space, Sui eclipsed many existing networks over its first year.

In early May last year, Sui's Mainnet made its public debut, actualizing the promise and proof points made by this next generation technology on Devnet and Testnet. As we reach Sui Mainnet's first anniversary, we look back on a year of growth and new, innovative features.
With its scalable architecture and performant consensus engine, Sui is built to handle massive traffic. And although we've seen peaks hitting over 5,000 transactions-per-second in its first year, the network has not yet reached its limit. By December of 2023 Sui hosted over nine million active accounts, and is well over 10 million now.
DeFi growth was absolutely extraordinary, with Total Value Locked rising from $100 million in early November last year to over $500 million in February.
Beyond metrics, Sui continues to see impressive development, with new features making it accessible and even more performant. zkLogin is an incredibly powerful tool builders leverage to onboard more users, while Pilotfish and Mysticeti promise to maintain Sui's performance edge.
