FAQ
### 
What is Sui Overflow 2025?

Participants will have the chance to build projects using Sui and the Move programming language while competing for prizes, mentorship, and exclusive developer initiatives.
### 
Why should I participate in Sui Overflow 2025?
Sui Overflow 2025 is a great opportunity to work closely with Sui Foundation, connect with top developers, and gain exposure to investors and mentors. There are a variety of prizes, and projects may also get invited to further developer initiatives.
### 
Who can participate in Sui Overflow 2025?
Anyone is welcome to participate in Sui Overflow 2025! Whether you're a seasoned Web3 developer, a designer, or just starting to explore blockchain, you’re welcome to join. There are no experience requirements—just bring your ideas and motivation.
### 
Where can I ask technical questions during the hackathon?
All technical questions should be asked in the Sui Hackathons Discord Server, where mentors and team members will be available to help.
### 
When can I register for Sui Overflow 2025?
Registration is open now at this link.
### 
Do I need to attend any in-person events or demo days to be eligible?
No. Sui Overflow is an online hackathon where registration, development, and assessment are all conducted virtually. There will be related in-person events, like developer meetups and workshops, but these are optional and attendance will not affect the assessment process.
### 
How can I find a team to join?
During the registration process, you can indicate if you’re looking for a team to be added to our team directory, where participants can find teammates to build with. Another place to search is in the official Sui Overflow Discord server. We will also host some team-matching events, which we’ll announce in the Discord server.
### 
How can I learn about Sui and Move to prepare for Sui Overflow?
There are many developer resources available to help you get started with Sui and Move. Access the Sui developer docs, explore developer tools and resources on the Sui developer portal, or take a self-paced intro course to Move to get started.
### 
When can I start working on my project for it to be considered as a valid submission?
To keep things fair, projects should only be started after the official hackathon start date February 12, 2025. The submission period officially opens on April 1, 2025, giving teams time to develop and refine their projects.
### 
What if my project fits into multiple tracks?
You'll need to pick the track that best represents your project. Judges will evaluate submissions based on the chosen track, so go with the one that aligns best with your idea.
If you have additional questions, please contact devrel@sui.io.
