Sui is taking a major step into payments and everyday utility through its partnership with _xMoney_, a next-generation financial platform for businesses, and _xPortal_, a leading crypto super-app. Thanks to this collaboration, a full-stack digital payment experience has arrived in Europe – immediately available to millions – with global expansion on the horizon.
## From onchain to checkout
As the global coordination layer for assets, Sui is uniquely positioned to power this mass-market use case thanks to its speed, throughput, and seamless user experience. This new offering is made possible by xPortal’s integration of Sui into its 2.5 million-user wallet, with xMoney providing the financial infrastructure that enables seamless spending and real-world utility.
The result is a custom Sui wallet experience within xPortal, complete with a branded virtual Mastercard that European users can seamlessly add to their Apple Pay and Google Pay wallets today. A physical Mastercard release is expected later this year. 
“This powerful new product is a significant step towards making the Sui ecosystem more accessible to everyday consumers – enabled by the seamless user experience and retail adoption of xPortal,” said Christian Thompson, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation. “The innovations of xPortal and xMoney showcase what’s possible when intuitive interfaces blend with strong infrastructure, while xMoney’s extensive licensing work makes it all possible in a compliant and secure way.”

## A unified wallet experience
xPortal, a leading crypto super-app, is bringing Sui into its suite of supported blockchains with a custom-branded experience that merges ease of use with self-custody. With xPortal, users around the globe can now buy, swap, stake, and spend crypto seamlessly, all within an intuitive interface that preserves the security and ownership benefits of self-custody. By unifying these core actions in one platform, xPortal connects crypto with the real world — fueling a new wave of mainstream adoption and innovation in the digital economy. 
“Sui stands out for its combination of high performance, user-friendly design, and its active, engaged community,” said Sergiu Biris, CEO of xPortal. “Integrating Sui into xPortal aligns perfectly with our mission to make crypto accessible to everyone. This partnership allows our users to seamlessly tap into Sui’s real-world utility, all within a single, beautifully designed super-app.”
xMoney powers this experience with a robust infrastructure, covering licensing, payment processing, and card issuing, tailored for regulated markets like the EU. Now, builders on Sui can access these tools to bring intuitive, compliant financial experiences to market faster.
“Our mission at xMoney is to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized economy,” said Greg Siourounis, CEO of xMoney. “Partnering with Sui allows us to provide builders and users with the compliance, infrastructure, and UX required to make crypto payments as easy and intuitive as any banking app.”
The partnership makes Sui one of the few Layer 1 blockchains supporting frictionless real-world payments and financial services through a fully compliant platform, starting in Europe and expanding globally. Starting today, users can pay with SUI at over 20,000 merchants within the xMoney payment solution.
## What’s next?
A deeper rollout is planned for later this year, including the reveal of physical custom-branded cards and expanded enterprise-focused offerings powered by xMoney. U.S. expansion is on the horizon, with additional product releases to be unveiled at Sui Basecamp.
